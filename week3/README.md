# Lab: 30.1.2025 
## Exercise on Numpy and Pandas (without using functions)

### 1. Create a 1D and 2D array using Numpy, and print its datatype, shape, and dimension.
   - **1D Array**: Create a 1D array.
   - **2D Array**: Create a 2D array.
   - Print:
     - Datatype
     - Shape
     - Dimension

### 2. Create a 1D and 2D array with the following initializations:
   - **i)** Random initialization
   - **ii)** Default initialization
   - Print:
     - Diagonal values
     - First element
     - Last element
     - 2nd row and 2nd column element
     - Number of elements

### 3. Find the following operations on a matrix:
   - Determinant
   - Addition
   - Multiplication
   - Subtraction
   - Division
   - Transpose
   - Cross Product
   - Dot Product

### 4. Print range values in 1D and 2D arrays.

### 5. Reshape an array.

### 6. Find the following statistical measures:
   - Min
   - Max
   - Sum
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
   - Standard Deviation (SD)

### 7. Create a boolean mask for values greater than 5:
   - Use the mask to filter out values less than or equal to 5.
   - Count the number of values greater than 5.

### 8. Fancy Indexing:
   - Use fancy indexing to access elements at specific indices.
   - Create a new array by selecting every other element.

### 9. Structured Array:
   - Create a structured array to store information about students (name, age, and grade).
   - Create a few sample students.
   - Access and modify specific fields of the structured array.

### 10. Linear Regression:
   | Study Hours (x₁) | Practice Tests (x₂) | Score (y) |
   |------------------|---------------------|-----------|
   | 2                | 1                   | 60        |
   | 3                | 2                   | 65        |
   | 4                | 2                   | 70        |
   | 5                | 3                   | 75        |
   | 6                | 3                   | 80        |

   Find the best fit line **without using functions**.
